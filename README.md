****CHATBOT AI****

**Overview**

ChatbotAI is a simple chatbot implemented in Python. It simulates human-like conversation by responding to user inputs based on predefined patterns. The chatbot uses the random and re modules to generate appropriate responses.

**Features:-**

 Pattern Matching: Responds to user inputs using predefined patterns.
 Random Responses: Generates random responses when no pattern matches.
 Loop Control: Continues the conversation until the user exits with "bye", "goodbye", or "exit".

**How It Works:**

**Importing Modules:**
 The program begins by importing the random and re modules.

**Defining Responses:**
 Two lists are defined: user_inputs and bot_responses. These contain predefined patterns and their corresponding responses.

**Generating Responses:**
 The generate_response function takes user input, checks for matches in the user_inputs list using re.search, and returns the corresponding response from the bot_responses list. If no match is found, it randomly selects a response from a default list.

**Conversation Loop:**
 The program runs an infinite loop, prompting the user for input. It exits when the user types "bye", "goodbye", or "exit".

**Getting Started:** :-

**Prerequisites:**-
 Python 3.x
